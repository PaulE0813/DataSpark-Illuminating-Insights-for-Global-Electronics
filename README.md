## DataSpark: Illuminating Insights for Global Electronics

### INTRODUCTION
As a member of Global Electronics' data analytics team, I was tasked with conducting a comprehensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to uncover valuable insights from our company's data. The goal was to provide
actionable recommendations that can enhance customer satisfaction, optimize operations, and drive overall business growth. This report details the process and findings from the analysis of datasets containing
information about customers, products, sales, stores, and currency exchange rates.

### Approach

# Data Cleaning and Preparation
- Check for missing values and handle them appropriately.
- Convert data types where necessary (e.g., dates, numerical values).
- Merge datasets where necessary for analysis (e.g., linking sales data with product and customer data).
# Load Data
- Insert the preprocessed data into an SQL database by creating relevant tables for each data source and using SQL INSERT statements to load the data.
# Power BI Visualization
- Connect SQL to Power BI/Tableau, import the data, and create interactive dashboards.
# Develop 10 SQL Queries
- Formulate and execute 10 SQL queries to extract key insights from the data. These queries should address important business questions and support the analysis steps below.


### OBJECTIVES
1. Enhance marketing strategies
2. Optimize inventory management
3. Improve sales forecasting
4. Develop better products
5. Plan effective promotions
6. Decide on store expansions and optimizations
7. Understand the impact of currency exchange rates on sales

### DATASETS
The datasets provided for analysis included:
1. Customers: Information about customer demographics and purchasing behavior.
2. Products: Details about the products sold, including categories and specifications.
3. Sales: Transaction data capturing sales details.
4. Stores: Information about store locations and performance metrics.
5. Currency Exchange Rates: Historical exchange rates relevant to our international sales.

### DATA CLEANING AND INTEGRATION
The initial step involved cleaning and integrating the datasets to ensure accuracy and consistency. The following actions were taken:
1. Missing Values: Imputed or removed missing values to maintain data integrity.
2. Duplicates: Identified, removed and replaced duplicate records.
3. Data Types: Ensured appropriate data types for each column.
4. Integration: Merged datasets on common keys such as CustomerKeys, ProductKeys, and StoreKeys to form a comprehensive dataset for analysis.
   
### CONCLUSION
This project has demonstrated the power of data-driven decision-making and the potential benefits of leveraging data analytics to inform business strategies. As we continue to refine our analytical approaches and incorporate new data sources, we can further enhance our understanding of the business and identify even more opportunities for improvement and growth.
